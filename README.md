# 🧠 SochStack
### Agentic AI Sandbox for Distributed System Design

**SochStack** is an AI-powered educational platform that helps developers learn distributed system architecture through real-time simulation instead of theory. Using a multi-agent system on Amazon Bedrock, it debates architectural decisions, generates Infrastructure-as-Code, deploys mock AWS environments, and visualizes performance bottlenecks using live metrics.

---

## 👨🏻‍🚒 How It Works
1. User submits system requirements in natural language.  
2. AI agents (Architect, Latency Critic, Security Guard) debate and reach consensus.  
3. AWS CloudFormation templates are generated automatically.  
4. Mock infrastructure runs using AWS Lambda + Amazon SNS.  
5. Amazon CloudWatch displays latency, throughput, and bottlenecks.
